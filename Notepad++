# Notepad++ Regular Expressions
- [!] finds the exclamation character.
- .* selects the rest of the line.
- (\+.*)(Item) \+ finds the + character. | .* selects the text after the + up until the word "Item" | Item finds the string "Item" | () allow us to access whatever is inside the parentheses. The first set of parentheses may be accessed with \1 and the second set with \2.
- \1\r\n\2 will take + and whatever text comes after it, will then add a new line, and place the string "Item" on the new line.
- A-Z finds all letters of the alphabet in upper case.
- a-z finds all lower case letters.
- A-Za-z will find all alphabetic characters.
- [^...] is the inverse. So, if we put these three together: [^A-Za-z] finds any character except an alphabetic character.
- Notice that only one of the [^A-Za-z] is in parentheses (). This is recalled by \1 in the Replace with field. The characters outside of the parentheses are discarded.
